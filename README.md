# Madison Area Precipitation Prediction

## Project Goal
This project will attempt to predict daily quantities of precipitation in the Madison area within a 90% confidence interval.

## Project Purpose
As an avid skier, this project intersects my interests in working with data and wanting to know what days are the best to go to my local ski hill. Precipitation makes an interesting data problem due to how interconnected so many factors are leading to eventual rainfall, providing many differing avenues on how to predict the end result.

## Methodology
Before the creation of the model, I had to learn more about what factors really contribute to precipitation in an area. I would then perform exploratory analysis on the data sources I've found before using that to guide my efforts in building an effective prediction model.

### Domain Knowledge
Given my lack of knowledge on what actually causes rainfall could be simplified to "water forms cloud and falls down," I needed to do more research on what measurable factors actually contribute to rain and how I can use that to predict rainfall on a local area.

The first misconception I had was how related humidity was to rainfall -- its main relationship is that humidity rises when it rains, rather than the other way around. While it can contribute to precipitation in the fact that higher humidity means more water vapor can form clouds, it is not as directly related as I first assumed.

Things I learned can also impact rainfall are things like air pressure differentials, solar radiation, and wind direction and speed. This last one is especially relevant because of "prevailing winds," which are the main directions winds will be going over long periods of time. In Madison specifically these are *WNW* during winter and early spring, changing to *S* for the rest of the year. Given rain clouds can travel quite far, keeping track of some weather measurements from those directions could increase model performance without significant overhead.

### Data Sources
Initial plans were to use data from NOAA for the Madison area from a recent timespan, but data found for and before 2006 provide additional data points that could be useful in predicting precipitation, including solar radiation, vapor pressure, and cloud cover. Some of these are available in less digestible forms for recent years, so exploratory analysis needs to determine if climate change
